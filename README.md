### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Video game developer and Front end developer,  from BogotÃ¡ - Colombia; i'm excited by the design of the user interfaces, the game levels, the narrative inspires me and I manage to create magical stories that generate greater expectations for the video game.
This game over UI that I designed made me discover how beautiful this is and how much I want to keep learning and evolving. ðŸ¥°
